# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: April 24, 2025**

The Sharly Chess project takes the protection of its users' personal data very seriously. The purpose of this page is to describe our practices and commitments regarding the processing of your personal data.

## Preliminary remarks

At this time, Sharly Chess does not collect any personal data from its users because the online services planned in the project's roadmap have not yet been implemented. By posting this privacy policy now, Sharly Chess intends to clearly demonstrate the particular attention it pays to protecting its users' personal data.

## Who is the controller of your personal data?

The controller is, within the meaning of the GDPR, the entity that defines the purposes for which and how your personal data is used.

The controller is Sharly Chess, an association governed by the law of July 1, 1901, whose registered office is located at Mr. Pascal AUBRY, 8 rue de la fontaine, Domloup (35410). You can contact us with any questions or concerns regarding the collection and use of your personal data by writing to us at [gdpr@sharly-chess.com](mailto:gdpr@sharly-chess.com).

As part of our activities, we may collect and process personal data relating to our users. These various data processing operations are detailed in this privacy policy.

## What data is collected about you and for what reasons?

### 1\. Connection to the sharly-chess.com website

When you connect to the sharly-chess.com website, certain data is automatically collected by the website host regarding your device (computer, smartphone, tablet) and your browser. This includes your IP address.

This data is collected to ensure the connection between your device and the website's servers, as well as to subsequently detect bugs (a bug is a design flaw in a computer program that causes a malfunction) and attempted cyberattacks.

The collection and processing of this data is therefore justified by Sharly Chess's legitimate interest in providing a functional, secure website adapted to the different types of devices and browsers available on the market, in accordance with Article 6.1.f) of the GDPR.

This data is kept for one year following its collection, then for the limitation period applicable for the purposes of managing disputes described in point 6 below.

### 2\. Account Creation and Management of Registered Users

Note: Currently, user login to the sharly-chess.com website is not implemented.

#### Information Required for Account Creation and Registered User Management

We collect the information you provide during registration, such as your first and last name, email address, and username.

This data processing allows Sharly Chess to manage its registered users and is justified by the performance of the contract to which you are a party, namely the Sharly Chess [Terms of Use]({% link _footer-links/terms-and-conditions.en.md %}), in accordance with Article 6.1.b) of the GDPR.

#### Optional information for account creation and registered user management

We also collect any optional information you may have provided to complete your profile.

This data processing is based on your consent, in accordance with Article 6.1.a) of the GDPR.

This data is retained until you withdraw your consent, then for the applicable limitation period for the purposes of dispute management described in section 6 below.

#### Session Cookies

Furthermore, Sharly Chess uses session cookies.

These cookies temporarily store the information you have provided to us and allow us to track your movements from one page to another on the site without requesting this information again (to authenticate you or store your preferences).

This data processing is based on Sharly Chess's legitimate interest in improving the browsing experience on its site, in accordance with Article 6.1.f) of the GDPR.

This data is stored for the duration of the browsing session; you can configure these cookies in your browser settings.

### 3\. Technical Support

When you contact us to resolve a technical issue, we collect certain information such as your first and last name, email address, and username, the date and time of your request, as well as the circumstances of the reported problem.

In addition, our administrators may need to access your account to identify a problem or take action on your behalf.

This data processing is justified by Sharly Chess's legitimate interest in providing technical support to its users, in accordance with Article 6.1.f) of the GDPR.

This data is retained until the issue is resolved, then for the applicable limitation period for the purposes of dispute management described in section 6 below.

### 4\. Improving Our Services

We use data relating to the use of our services to develop these services to make them increasingly efficient for our users.

The data processed for this purpose includes user browsing data on our services.

This data processing is justified by Sharly Chess's legitimate interest in developing and improving its services, in accordance with Article 6.1.f) of the GDPR.

We only retain this data for the duration necessary for the analysis that allows us to identify ways to improve our services.

### 5\. Donations and Purchases of Goods

If you make a donation to our association or purchase goods from our online stores, we will collect your email address, the amount, and the transaction number.

This data processing is justified by the performance of the contract, namely the transaction, in accordance with Article 6.1.b) of the GDPR.

This data is retained until full payment, then for the applicable limitation period for the purposes of dispute management described in section 6. below.

With your consent, we will publish your username and the amount of your donation on our website, for the sake of transparency.

This data processing is based on your consent, in accordance with Article 6.1.a) of the GDPR.

This data is retained until you withdraw your consent, then for the applicable limitation period for the purposes of dispute management described in section 6. below.

### 6\. Dispute Management (Potential or Current)

We may retain any data that we deem necessary or useful to prevent a dispute and manage any litigation or pre-litigation.

We use this data, where applicable, to prevent, initiate, or respond to such a dispute, whether or not you are a party to the dispute (for example, a dispute relating to the use of our services).

This retention is justified by Sharly Chess's legitimate interest in protecting and defending its rights and interests, including in court, in accordance with Article 6.1.f) of the GDPR.

We will therefore retain all relevant data from an evidentiary perspective for the legally applicable limitation period, which is generally 5 years (common law civil limitation period).

### 7\. Compliance with a Legal Obligation

We may retain any data that we deem necessary to comply with our legal obligations, for the period necessary to comply with these obligations.

This retention is justified by compliance with a legal obligation to which Sharly Chess is subject, in accordance with Article 6.1.c) of the GDPR.

We will retain this data for one year, then for the legally applicable limitation period according to the legal obligations concerned.

### 8\. Further Processing of Data for Statistical Purposes

To ensure the maintenance of statistics relating to the use of our services on the sharly-chess.com website, we retain your username and other non-personal information.

This further processing is compatible with the initial collection of your identifier, justified by the performance of the contract in accordance with Article 6.1.b) of the GDPR as indicated in point 2 above, in accordance with recital 50 and Articles 5 and 89 of the GDPR.

## Who has access to your data?

Your data is hosted by a secure professional service provider on servers located in France. Sharly Chess teams, moderators, and employees may access it within the scope and limits of their duties.

Some of your data may also be accessed or at least hosted by the following individuals and organizations:

*   Technical service providers assisting Sharly Chess with the maintenance and development of the sharly-chess.com website;
*   Sharly Chess's legal advisors, accounting firms, and lawyers;
*   Payment service providers and banking institutions used by Sharly Chess for its fundraising.

Note: As it stands, Sharly Chess does not rely on any external service providers.

## What rights do you have to control the processing of your personal data?

You have, like any other person whose personal data we collect and process, a number of rights provided for by the regulations.

You will find details below, followed by a summary table.

You can exercise these rights simply by writing directly to the following email address: [gdpr@sharly-chess.com](mailto:gdpr@sharly-chess.com).

Remember to clearly indicate in your email the nature of the right you wish to exercise and the reasons, if applicable, justifying your request to exercise this right.

Note: As things stand, Sharly Chess does not collect any personal data from its users.

### 1\. Right of Access

You can ask us for confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning you is being processed and, if so, access to said data.

As such, you have the right to request a copy of the personal data we hold about you, in an easily understandable format, as well as a copy of this Policy on a durable medium.

Note: When Sharly Chess holds its users' personal data, a URL will be provided for exercising this right of access.

### 2\. Right of Rectification

You may ask us to correct, complete, or update the data we hold about you if it appears to be inaccurate, incomplete, or outdated.

In this case, we would appreciate it if you could provide us with the new information needed to correct, complete, or update your information.

### 3\. Right to Withdraw Consent

For processing based on your consent, you may withdraw this consent at any time, without providing any justification. Withdrawing your consent will result in the cessation of future processing.

### 4\. Right to object

#### Data processing based on Sharly Chess's legitimate interest

With regard to the data processing operations listed above that are based on Sharly Chess's legitimate interests, you have the right to object for reasons relating to your particular situation.

In other words, you can request that Sharly Chess cease any of these processing operations with respect to you, by explaining the specific reasons justifying this request.

However, Sharly Chess may refuse to comply with your request if continued processing is necessary for legitimate and compelling reasons from our perspective (for example, if the data in question is necessary to protect and defend Sharly Chess's rights in court or for public information purposes).

#### Data Processed for Statistical Purposes

Regarding data processing for statistical purposes, you have the right to object for reasons relating to your particular situation, unless the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest.

An objection (if it is based on valid reasons and there are no overriding legitimate grounds to object, or if the processing is not necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest) will result in the cessation of processing for the future, but not necessarily the destruction of the data concerned. To obtain this destruction, you must exercise your right to erasure under the conditions described below, it being specified that this right is subject to limitations, as set out below.

### 5\. Right to erasure

You may request that we delete all or part of the data we hold about you, provided that at least one of the following conditions is met:

*   The data in question no longer appears necessary for any of the purposes previously set out;
*   You have withdrawn your consent in accordance with point 3 above;
*   You have objected to the continuation of this processing in accordance with point 4 above, and further wish Sharly Chess to destroy the data in question;
*   You consider that your personal data has been unlawfully processed by Sharly Chess;
*   The data in question must be erased due to a legal obligation;
*   The data in question relates to a person who was under the age of fifteen (15) when the data was collected. 

Please note, however, that Sharly Chess has the right to object to the deletion of certain data when its retention is necessary for particularly important reasons, such as the protection and defense of its legal interests.

Furthermore, we may choose, instead of deleting the data, to completely and irreversibly anonymize it. In this way, we will be entitled to retain this data in a format that no longer allows you to be identified (for example, for statistical purposes).

### 6\. Right to Restrict Processing

If you fail to exercise your right to erasure, for example, you may also ask Sharly Chess to "set aside" or "freeze" certain data concerning you, i.e., to keep this data separately and without further use (except for legal obligations).

*   You may make such a request when at least one of the following conditions is met:
*   The data in question appears inaccurate to you, and you prefer that Sharly Chess cease using it while it verifies and corrects it, if necessary;
*   You consider that your personal data has been unlawfully processed by Sharly Chess, but you opt to restrict its use rather than delete it;
*   The data in question is no longer necessary for any of the purposes set out above, but you wish Sharly Chess to retain it nonetheless for the purposes of defending your interests in court;
*   You have exercised your right to object in accordance with point 4 above, and you prefer that Sharly Chess cease using the data in question while we verify the validity of your objection.

In these cases, we will "freeze" the data for the necessary period, for example by marking it "Do not use -- Right to restriction exercised."

### 7\. Right to Data Portability

You may ask us to send you a copy of the data collected based on your consent, allowing its reuse by you or another service provider.

This "right to portability" differs from the right of access mentioned in point 1 above in that its purpose is not to obtain a copy that is necessarily readable by you, but rather a reusable copy of the data, particularly for the purpose of changing service providers.

### 8\. Right to define instructions regarding the fate of your data after your death

Finally, you have the right to indicate how you would like us to handle your data in the unfortunate event of your death.

In particular, you can ask us to destroy all of your data (subject to any compelling retention requirements we may have, for example, to defend Sharly Chess's rights in court), or to transmit a copy of all of this data to the person of your choice.

You can also designate any person of your choice as responsible for executing these "last wishes"; this person does not necessarily have to be one of your heirs or even the executor of your estate.
