# Getting Started

_Sharly Chess_ is a free, open-source, no-nonsense tool for managing individual chess tournaments. It takes care of everything from check-ins and pairings to FIDE exports. Built with practical tournament needs in mind, it also includes support for external displays and even allows players to enter their own results when appropriate.

Unlike many other options, a core principle of _Sharly Chess_ is that it runs entirely on the arbiter’s machine — no internet connection required. The last thing an arbiter needs is an internet issue or server failure during a 200-player tournament!

## France specific-ish, for now...

The current version is designed as a complement to _[Papi](https://www.echecs.asso.fr/Actu.aspx?Ref=14287)_, the official software of the French Chess Federation, and is currently tailored to tournaments in France. That said, development is moving very quickly toward a fully independent version that can be used anywhere in the world.
