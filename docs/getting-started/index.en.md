# Getting Started

_Sharly Chess_ is a free, open-source, no-nonsense tool for managing individual chess tournaments.
It takes care of everything from check-ins and pairings to FIDE exports.
Built with practical tournament needs for arbiters in mind, it also includes functionalities for organizers and players (display of pairings, results, timer and results input).

**_Sharly Chess_ runs completely autonomously** on the arbiter's computer:
Unlike many other solutions, **no internet connection is required during tournaments**
(you don't have to worry about network outages or the availability of an online server or hosting provider).

## France specific-ish, for now...

_Sharly Chess_ was designed as a complement to _[Papi](https://www.echecs.asso.fr/Actu.aspx?Ref=14287)_, the official software of the French Chess Federation.

The current version is therefore a dedicated solution for tournaments organized in France.

That said, a future version will be completely independent of Papi for use anywhere in the world.
