# Rotators

If you want to display multiple Screens on a single device — such as a projector — you can use a **Rotator** to automatically cycle through them.

---

## Creating a Rotator

To create a Rotator, go to the **Rotators** page and click the **Create a Rotator** button.

When setting up your Rotator, you can select which **Individual Screens** and **Screen Families** to include.
The Rotator will automatically rotate between the selected Screens.

If you include a **Screen Family**, the Rotator will cycle through **all individual Screens** generated by that Family.

{: .warning }
> ⚠︎ Rotators are designed for **displaying** Screens only — not for **entering** results.
> If you include a result entry Screen and someone interacts with it, the Rotator will stop rotating.
