# Player Databases

When adding players to a tournament, you can search the **FIDE database** or any other player database provided by a federation via a [plugin]({{ site.baseurl }}/plugin-support).

The FIDE database must be downloaded and installed locally before it can be used. Plugins may also provide additional databases that behave the same way, or they may add support for online player databases.

## Database Management

You can manage all local player databases from the **Databases** page, accessible via the database icon in the navigation menu.

For each database, you can choose to:
- **Update automatically** when _Sharly Chess_ starts
- **Receive a warning** when the database is outdated (based on the number of days you define).  In this case the database icon will display a warning sign.
- **Update manually** at any time â€” especially handy on the morning of a tournament

This system ensures you always have the latest player info at your fingertips, without relying on an internet connection during the event.
