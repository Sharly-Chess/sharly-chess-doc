# The ChessEvent Plugin

The ChessEvent plugin allows you to interface with the ChessEvent registration platform operated by the Brittany Chess League.

## Accessing the ChessEvent Platform

Activating this plugin adds the following functionality to Sharly Chess:
- Retrieving tournament registrations from the ChessEvent platform.

## Using the Plugin

To retrieve tournament registrations from the ChessEvent platform, you must specify the following information in the tournament configuration:
- the username used to log in to the ChessEvent platform;
- the password used to log in to the ChessEvent platform;
- the ChessEvent event ID (on the ChessEvent platform);
- the tournament ID (on the ChessEvent platform).

## Exemple

For this tournament:

- the ChessEvent ID is in the page URL (here `BRE_35_Bretagnejeunes2025`);
- the tournament ID is the text of the corresponding button (here `Tournoi U12`).
