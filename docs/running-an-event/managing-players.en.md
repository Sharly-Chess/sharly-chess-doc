# Managing Players

The player list, accessible via the **Players** item in the navigation menu, displays all players added to the Event — across all Tournaments.

You can sort and filter the table using the column headers, making it easy to manage large lists of participants.

## Adding Players

Players can be added using the **Add Player** button.

While you can enter a player's details manually, it’s often quicker and more reliable to use the **FIDE database** or a local federation database (provided via a plugin) to search and import existing player records. See the [Player Databases]({{ site.baseurl }}/player-databases) section for more details on installing and using these databases.

## Changing Tournaments

At the start of an event, it's common for players to switch between tournaments — for example, from an Open section to a U1600 section. You can update a player’s tournament assignment directly from the **Tournament** field in the Players table.

## Updating Players from the Latest Databases

To ensure player information — especially ELO ratings — is up to date, _Sharly Chess_ allows you to sync your player list with the latest versions of your installed databases.

Click the **Update Players** button to choose which databases to use. If differences are found between your list and the database entries, you will be prompted to review and confirm any updates before applying them.
