# Getting Started

## Overview

An **Event** in _Sharly Chess_ includes one or more individual **Tournaments** — typically grouped by rating ranges, though you're free to organize your event however you like.

You’ll probably want to create your Event well in advance and start adding players as they register. _Sharly Chess_ makes it easy to pull players from the FIDE database, as well as other sources depending on the plugins you’ve activated. Once added, players can be moved between tournaments with just a few clicks.

On the day of the event, you can use _Sharly Chess_ to check in players as they arrive. If you'd like, you can also set up tablets or laptops to let players check themselves in.

Once everyone is ready, you can generate pairings and start the tournaments. The pairings can be printed or displayed via a projector if you have one available.

As the round progresses, you can enter results manually — or let players enter their own results using a tablet or computer. If you're displaying the results on a screen, players can verify that their game was recorded correctly. This saves the arbiter time and reduces the chance of entry errors.

After each round, you can generate a ranking list or cross table for players to review — again, either on paper or on a screen.

At the end of the tournament, _Sharly Chess_ can generate a TRF file of the results — the standard format recognized by FIDE.

{: .note }
> ⚠︎  _Sharly Chess_ is currently writes the tournament results directly to the _Papi_ file, so arbiters in France should continue to upload this file directly to the _Fédération Française des Échecs_ site.
>
> Future versions of _Sharly Chess_ will be independent of _Papi_ and will instead write the results to a separate database file.  It will then be possible to export a tournament to _Papi_ format in order to upload the tournament results directly to the _Fédération Française des Échecs_ site until such time as this site accepts TRF files.
