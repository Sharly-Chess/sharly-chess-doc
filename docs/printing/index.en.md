## Printing

The print dialog can be accessed in two ways:

- Via the **"Print"** option in the sidebar navigation
- From the **actions menu** on a tournament card (on the tournaments page). In this case, the tournament will be preselected in the print dialog.

Sharly Chess can generate a wide variety of documents intended for display during a tournament.
The selected document will open in a new browser tab, allowing you to print it as you would any standard document.

Here’s a brief overview of the available document types:

---

### List of Players

In FIDE tournaments, it is mandatory to display a full list of players. This document includes each player’s name, rating, age category, gender, federation, and club.

---

### Check-in List

Sharly Chess offers several ways to check players in before the start of a tournament. Arbiters can:

- Manually check players in using the Sharly Chess interface
- Allow players to check themselves in via a [Screen]({% link docs/screens/single-screens.en.md %}) using a tablet or computer

Alternatively, you can opt for a more traditional approach with a printed check-in list. It includes:

- A checkbox for attendance
- The player’s name, rating, age category, gender, etc.
- Paid and due amounts
- And comments associated with the player

### Pairings

Once the tournament is running, you’ll likely want to display the pairings for each round. This listing includes all pairings for the selected round, showing board numbers and current points.

---

### Berger Grid

Used in round-robin tournaments, this grid displays all pairings for every round.

---

### Results

This listing is identical to the pairings list but includes the results of each game.

---

### Ranking

Displays the current tournament standings, including player scores and tie-break values.

---

### Crosstable

Provides a comprehensive overview of the current standings, including round-by-round results for each player.

---

### Round Performance Listing

This document ranks players based on their performance for a specific round (_not_ the full tournament).
The performance is calculated as the difference between the player’s rating and their round performance (calculated similarly to the TPR — Tournament Performance Rating — tie-break).

This can be useful for awarding per-round prizes or for any other creative ideas that the organisers may have.

---

### Prize List

Prints the list of prizes defined for the tournament. According to FIDE regulations, this list must be displayed no later than halfway through the event.

---

### Prize Assignment

Once the tournament is complete, you can generate the list of prize winners based on final standings.
