The ``ffe.bat`` script located in the ``tools`` folder has been removed: FFE operations are now fully integrated into the _Sharly Chess_ web interface:

- Upload results;
- Publish rules;
- Retrieve fees.

This version also includes:
- the lottery, which allows players to be randomly drawn from tournaments;
- tournament exports in PGN and TRF 16 formats.
