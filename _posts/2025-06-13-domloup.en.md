On Friday, June 13th, 2025, a tournament took place in Domloup, bringing together 223 schoolchildren, who had little or no experience with competition.

_Sharly Chess_ made easy the players' check-in and reduced the time needed between each round thanks to alphabetical pairings (without displaying opponents to limit the number of screens needed).

_Sharly Chess_ also helped to limit the time needed to enter the results, done by the children with the help of adult volunteers.

A pre-release 2.8 was used end-to-end without the use of _Papi_, with _Sharly Chess_'s internal pairing engine (_bbpPairings_).

The network configuration used was:
- the shared connection of a smartphone to create a local Wi-Fi network (the internet connection was not used);
- the server, used by the arbiter for screen configuration, check-in, and pairings;
- three computers displaying pairings in alphabetical order (with three display controllers on three rotators);
- two computers used to enter the results.

Except for the _Sharly Chess_ server itself, all other computers used are outdated (20 years old) computers with a minimal operating system (_Linux Mint_) and a web browser connected to the server.

Thanks to this system, the children were able to play 5 rounds with a time control of 7 minutes + 3 seconds per move from 12:45 p.m. to 3:15 p.m. People used to such school competitions know that this is a real feat!
