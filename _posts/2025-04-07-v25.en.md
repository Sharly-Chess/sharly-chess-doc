A few months after the release of version 2.4 (last November), we are pleased to announce version 2.5 of Papi-web.

Version 2.5 brings the following new features:

* Complete interface overhaul
* Multi-language support (FR and EN)
* Player management tab: manual addition, deletion, creation from the FIDE and FFE player databases, update from the FIDE and FFE player databases, tournament changes, player history management, bye allocation
* Print management: pairings by board, pairings by alphabetical order, rankings, crosstables
* New screens for displaying rankings and crosstables
* More details are available online on the project's GitHub repository: https://github.com/papi-web-org/papi-web/releases
 <!--more-->

{: .warning }
> ⚠️ Important
>
> The tie-breaks computed are the same as those computed by Papi to insure that the rankings displayed on the FFE website are the same as the ones produced by Papi-web; tie-break calculations that comply with FIDE guidelines are already implemented but will only be available in a future version.
> It is still necessary to rely on Papi for pairings (this will no longer be the case in a future version).

The last few months have been particularly intense for the project; you will appreciate the incredible progress made in version 2.5.

These developments will continue in the coming weeks and months:

* Integration of the latest unimplemented Papi features
* Integration of a pairing engine
* Discontinuation of the Access format
* Additional features
* We will also begin the process of getting Sharly Chess endorsed by the FIDE, to make it a tool that can be used by all federations.

More details on the [project roadmap](https://github.com/papi-web-org/papi-web/blob/dev/docs/02-roadmap.md).

We hope you enjoy this new version and look forward to your feedback to continue improving the application.
